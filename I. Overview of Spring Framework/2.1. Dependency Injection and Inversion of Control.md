### 2.1 Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control

A Java application — a loose term that runs the gamut from constrained, embedded applications to n-tier, server-side enterprise applications — typically consists of objects that collaborate to form the application proper. Thus the objects in an application have dependencies on each other. 
一个java应用程序，可以在各个范围中运行，从约束的嵌入式应用程序到有多层结构的企业级应用，通常在应用层都是互相合作的Object。并且这些object是互相依赖的。 


Although the Java platform provides a wealth of application development functionality, it lacks the means to organize the basic building blocks into a coherent whole, leaving that task to architects and developers. Although you can use design patterns such as Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Decorator, and Service Locator to compose the various classes and object instances that make up an application, these patterns are simply that: best practices given a name, with a description of what the pattern does, where to apply it, the problems it addresses, and so forth. Patterns are formalized best practices that you must implement yourself in your application.
尽管java平台提供了一套健全的应用开发平台，但是也缺乏将基础控件组合成整体的方法，并且将其留给了设计和开发人员。尽管你可以使用设计模式例如工厂、抽象工厂、builder、装饰器和service locator来将不同class和object组合起来构建你的应用。这些模式很简单，好的设计模式说明了其作用、在什么情况下使用、其能解决的问题等等。而这些模式必须你自己在应用中手动实现。

The Spring Framework Inversion of Control \(IoC\) component addresses this concern by providing a formalized means of composing disparate components into a fully working application ready for use. The Spring Framework codifies formalized design patterns as first-class objects that you can integrate into your own application\(s\). Numerous organizations and institutions use the Spring Framework in this manner to engineer robust, maintainable applications.
Spring的IOC框架描绘了一种通过提供有效的方法使得分散的组件组合成一个完整的应用程序以方便使用的构想。Spring框架将常用的设计模式作为直接组件以便你可以方便的集成到你的应用中。许多的组织和机构将Spring框架用于管理应用。

> Background  
> "The question is, what aspect of control are \[they\] inverting?" Martin Fowler posed this question about Inversion of Control \(IoC\) on his site in 2004. Fowler suggested renaming the principle to make it more self-explanatory and came up with Dependency Injection.
