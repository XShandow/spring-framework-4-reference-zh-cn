### 2. Introduction to the Spring Framework 介绍
The Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.
Spring作为一个Java平台为了支持你开发应用提供了各种各样的基础控件。Spring处理基础控件，你就可以关注你的应用。

Spring enables you to build applications from "plain old Java objects" (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.

Examples of how you, as an application developer, can benefit from the Spring platform:

Make a Java method execute in a database transaction without having to deal with transaction APIs.
Make a local Java method an HTTP endpoint without having to deal with the Servlet API.
Make a local Java method a message handler without having to deal with the JMS API.
Make a local Java method a management operation without having to deal with the JMX API.
