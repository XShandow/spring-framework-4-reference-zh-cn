### 2.3.1 Dependency Management and Naming Conventions

Dependency management and dependency injection are different things. To get those nice features of Spring into your application (like dependency injection) you need to assemble all the libraries needed (jar files) and get them onto your classpath at runtime, and possibly at compile time. These dependencies are not virtual components that are injected, but physical resources in a file system (typically). The process of dependency management involves locating those resources, storing them and adding them to classpaths. Dependencies can be direct (e.g. my application depends on Spring at runtime), or indirect (e.g. my application depends on `commons-dbcp` which depends on `commons-pool`). The indirect dependencies are also known as "transitive" and it is those dependencies that are hardest to identify and manage.

If you are going to use Spring you need to get a copy of the jar libraries that comprise the pieces of Spring that you need. To make this easier Spring is packaged as a set of modules that separate the dependencies as much as possible, so for example if you don’t want to write a web application you don’t need the spring-web modules. To refer to Spring library modules in this guide we use a shorthand naming convention `spring-* `or `spring-*.jar`, where` *` represents the short name for the module (e.g. `spring-core`, `spring-webmvc`, `spring-jms`, etc.). The actual jar file name that you use is normally the module name concatenated with the version number (e.g. spring-core-4.3.11.RELEASE.jar).

Each release of the Spring Framework will publish artifacts to the following places:

* Maven Central, which is the default repository that Maven queries, and does not require any special configuration to use. Many of the common libraries that Spring depends on also are available from Maven Central and a large section of the Spring community uses Maven for dependency management, so this is convenient for them. The names of the jars here are in the form `spring-*-<version>.jar` and the Maven groupId is `org.springframework`.
* In a public Maven repository hosted specifically for Spring. In addition to the final GA releases, this repository also hosts development snapshots and milestones. The jar file names are in the same form as Maven Central, so this is a useful place to get development versions of Spring to use with other libraries deployed in Maven Central. This repository also contains a bundle distribution zip file that contains all Spring jars bundled together for easy download.
So the first thing you need to decide is how to manage your dependencies: we generally recommend the use of an automated system like Maven, Gradle or Ivy, but you can also do it manually by downloading all the jars yourself.

Below you will find the list of Spring artifacts. For a more complete description of each module, see Section 2.2, “Framework Modules”.
