### 2.3.1 Dependency Management and Naming Conventions 依赖关系管理和命名约定

Dependency management and dependency injection are different things. To get those nice features of Spring into your application (like dependency injection) you need to assemble all the libraries needed (jar files) and get them onto your classpath at runtime, and possibly at compile time. These dependencies are not virtual components that are injected, but physical resources in a file system (typically). The process of dependency management involves locating those resources, storing them and adding them to classpaths. Dependencies can be direct (e.g. my application depends on Spring at runtime), or indirect (e.g. my application depends on `commons-dbcp` which depends on `commons-pool`). The indirect dependencies are also known as "transitive" and it is those dependencies that are hardest to identify and manage.
