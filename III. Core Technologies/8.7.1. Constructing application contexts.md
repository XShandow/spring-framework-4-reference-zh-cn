### 8.7.1 Constructing application contexts

An application context constructor \(for a specific application context type\) generally takes a string or array of strings as the location path\(s\) of the resource\(s\) such as XML files that make up the definition of the context.

When such a location path doesn’t have a prefix, the specific`Resource`type built from that path and used to load the bean definitions, depends on and is appropriate to the specific application context. For example, if you create a`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`as follows:

```
ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("conf/appContext.xml");
```

The bean definitions will be loaded from the classpath, as a`ClassPathResource`will be used. But if you create a`FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`as follows:

```
ApplicationContext ctx =
    new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("conf/appContext.xml");
```

The bean definition will be loaded from a filesystem location, in this case relative to the current working directory.

Note that the use of the special classpath prefix or a standard URL prefix on the location path will override the default type of`Resource`created to load the definition. So this`FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`…​

```
ApplicationContext ctx =
    new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("classpath:conf/appContext.xml");
```

1. will actually load its bean definitions from the classpath. However, it is still a`FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`. If it is subsequently used as a`ResourceLoader`, any unprefixed paths will still be treated as filesystem paths.

#### Constructing ClassPathXmlApplicationContext instances - shortcuts

The`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`exposes a number of constructors to enable convenient instantiation. The basic idea is that one supplies merely a string array containing just the filenames of the XML files themselves \(without the leading path information\), and one\_also\_supplies a`Class`; the`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`will derive the path information from the supplied class.

An example will hopefully make this clear. Consider a directory layout that looks like this:

```
com/
  foo/
    services.xml
    daos.xml
    MessengerService.class
```

A`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`instance composed of the beans defined in the`'services.xml'`and`'daos.xml'`could be instantiated like so…​

```
ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
    new String[] {"services.xml", "daos.xml"}, MessengerService.class);
```

Please do consult the`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`javadocs for details on the various constructors.
