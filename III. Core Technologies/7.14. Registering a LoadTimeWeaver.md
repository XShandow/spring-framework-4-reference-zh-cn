## 7.14 Registering a LoadTimeWeaver

The`LoadTimeWeaver`is used by Spring to dynamically transform classes as they are loaded into the Java virtual machine \(JVM\).

To enable load-time weaving add the`@EnableLoadTimeWeaving`to one of your`@Configuration`classes:

```
@Configuration
@EnableLoadTimeWeaving
public class AppConfig {

}
```

Alternatively for XML configuration use the`context:load-time-weaver`element:

```
<beans>
    <context:load-time-weaver/>
</beans>
```

Once configured for the`ApplicationContext`. Any bean within that`ApplicationContext`may implement`LoadTimeWeaverAware`, thereby receiving a reference to the load-time weaver instance. This is particularly useful in combination with[Spring’s JPA support](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#orm-jpa)where load-time weaving may be necessary for JPA class transformation. Consult the`LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean`javadocs for more detail. For more on AspectJ load-time weaving, see[Section 11.8.4, “Load-time weaving with AspectJ in the Spring Framework”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#aop-aj-ltw).
