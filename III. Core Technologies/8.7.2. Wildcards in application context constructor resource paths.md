### 8.7.2 Wildcards in application context constructor resource paths
应用上下文构造器资源路径中的通配符

The resource paths in application context constructor values may be a simple path \(as shown above\) which has a one-to-one mapping to a target Resource, or alternately may contain the special "classpath\*:" prefix and/or internal Ant-style regular expressions \(matched using Spring’s`PathMatcher`utility\). Both of the latter are effectively wildcards

One use for this mechanism is when doing component-style application assembly. All components can 'publish' context definition fragments to a well-known location path, and when the final application context is created using the same path prefixed via`classpath*:`, all component fragments will be picked up automatically.

Note that this wildcarding is specific to use of resource paths in application context constructors \(or when using the`PathMatcher`utility class hierarchy directly\), and is resolved at construction time. It has nothing to do with the`Resource`type itself. It’s not possible to use the`classpath*:`prefix to construct an actual`Resource`, as a resource points to just one resource at a time.

#### Ant-style Patterns

When the path location contains an Ant-style pattern, for example:

```
/WEB-INF/*-context.xml
  com/mycompany/**/applicationContext.xml
  file:C:/some/path/*-context.xml
  classpath:com/mycompany/**/applicationContext.xml
```

The resolver follows a more complex but defined procedure to try to resolve the wildcard. It produces a Resource for the path up to the last non-wildcard segment and obtains a URL from it. If this URL is not a`jar:`URL or container-specific variant \(e.g.`zip:`in WebLogic,`wsjar`in WebSphere, etc.\), then a`java.io.File`is obtained from it and used to resolve the wildcard by traversing the filesystem. In the case of a jar URL, the resolver either gets a`java.net.JarURLConnection`from it or manually parses the jar URL and then traverses the contents of the jar file to resolve the wildcards.

##### Implications on portability

If the specified path is already a file URL \(either explicitly, or implicitly because the base`ResourceLoader`is a filesystem one, then wildcarding is guaranteed to work in a completely portable fashion.

If the specified path is a classpath location, then the resolver must obtain the last non-wildcard path segment URL via a`Classloader.getResource()`call. Since this is just a node of the path \(not the file at the end\) it is actually undefined \(in the`ClassLoader`javadocs\) exactly what sort of a URL is returned in this case. In practice, it is always a`java.io.File`representing the directory, where the classpath resource resolves to a filesystem location, or a jar URL of some sort, where the classpath resource resolves to a jar location. Still, there is a portability concern on this operation.

If a jar URL is obtained for the last non-wildcard segment, the resolver must be able to get a`java.net.JarURLConnection`from it, or manually parse the jar URL, to be able to walk the contents of the jar, and resolve the wildcard. This will work in most environments, but will fail in others, and it is strongly recommended that the wildcard resolution of resources coming from jars be thoroughly tested in your specific environment before you rely on it.

#### The Classpath\*: portability classpath\*: prefix

When constructing an XML-based application context, a location string may use the special`classpath*:`prefix:

```
ApplicationContext ctx =
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("classpath*:conf/appContext.xml");
```

This special prefix specifies that all classpath resources that match the given name must be obtained \(internally, this essentially happens via a`ClassLoader.getResources(…​)`call\), and then merged to form the final application context definition.

> The wildcard classpath relies on the`getResources()`method of the underlying classloader. As most application servers nowadays supply their own classloader implementation, the behavior might differ especially when dealing with jar files. A simple test to check if`classpath*`works is to use the classloader to load a file from within a jar on the classpath:`getClass().getClassLoader().getResources("<someFileInsideTheJar>")`. Try this test with files that have the same name but are placed inside two different locations. In case an inappropriate result is returned, check the application server documentation for settings that might affect the classloader behavior. |

The`classpath*:`prefix can also be combined with a`PathMatcher`pattern in the rest of the location path, for example`classpath*:META-INF/*-beans.xml`. In this case, the resolution strategy is fairly simple: a`ClassLoader.getResources()`call is used on the last non-wildcard path segment to get all the matching resources in the class loader hierarchy, and then off each resource the same PathMatcher resolution strategy described above is used for the wildcard subpath.

#### Other notes relating to wildcards

Please note that`classpath*:`when combined with Ant-style patterns will only work reliably with at least one root directory before the pattern starts, unless the actual target files reside in the file system. This means that a pattern like`classpath*:*.xml`will not retrieve files from the root of jar files but rather only from the root of expanded directories. This originates from a limitation in the JDK’s`ClassLoader.getResources()`method which only returns file system locations for a passed-in empty string \(indicating potential roots to search\).

Ant-style patterns with`classpath:`resources are not guaranteed to find matching resources if the root package to search is available in multiple class path locations. This is because a resource such as

```
com/mycompany/package1/service-context.xml
```

may be in only one location, but when a path such as

```
classpath:com/mycompany/**/service-context.xml
```

is used to try to resolve it, the resolver will work off the \(first\) URL returned by`getResource("com/mycompany")`;. If this base package node exists in multiple classloader locations, the actual end resource may not be underneath. Therefore, preferably, use " \`classpath\*:\`" with the same Ant-style pattern in such a case, which will search all class path locations that contain the root package.
