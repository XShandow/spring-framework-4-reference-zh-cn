## 7.16 The BeanFactory

The`BeanFactory`provides the underlying basis for Spring’s IoC functionality but it is only used directly in integration with other third-party frameworks and is now largely historical in nature for most users of Spring. The`BeanFactory`and related interfaces, such as`BeanFactoryAware`,`InitializingBean`,`DisposableBean`, are still present in Spring for the purposes of backward compatibility with the large number of third-party frameworks that integrate with Spring. Often third-party components that can not use more modern equivalents such as`@PostConstruct`or`@PreDestroy`in order to remain compatible with JDK 1.4 or to avoid a dependency on JSR-250.

This section provides additional background into the differences between the`BeanFactory`and`ApplicationContext`and how one might access the IoC container directly through a classic singleton lookup.
