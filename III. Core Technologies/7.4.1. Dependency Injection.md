### 7.4.1Â Dependency Injection

_Dependency injection_\(DI\) is a process whereby objects define their dependencies, that is, the other objects they work with, only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then_injects_those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse, hence the name_Inversion of Control_\(IoC\), of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies on its own by using direct construction of classes, or the_Service Locator_pattern.

Code is cleaner with the DI principle and decoupling is more effective when objects are provided with their dependencies. The object does not look up its dependencies, and does not know the location or class of the dependencies. As such, your classes become easier to test, in particular when the dependencies are on interfaces or abstract base classes, which allow for stub or mock implementations to be used in unit tests.

DI exists in two major variants,[Constructor-based dependency injection](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-constructor-injection)and[Setter-based dependency injection](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-setter-injection).
