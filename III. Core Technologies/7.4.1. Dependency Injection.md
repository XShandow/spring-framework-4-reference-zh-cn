### 7.4.1 Dependency Injection

_Dependency injection_\(DI\) is a process whereby objects define their dependencies, that is, the other objects they work with, only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then_injects\_those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse, hence the name\_Inversion of Control_\(IoC\), of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies on its own by using direct construction of classes, or the\_Service Locator\_pattern.

Code is cleaner with the DI principle and decoupling is more effective when objects are provided with their dependencies. The object does not look up its dependencies, and does not know the location or class of the dependencies. As such, your classes become easier to test, in particular when the dependencies are on interfaces or abstract base classes, which allow for stub or mock implementations to be used in unit tests.

DI exists in two major variants,[Constructor-based dependency injection](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-constructor-injection)and[Setter-based dependency injection](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-setter-injection).

#### Constructor-based dependency injection

\_Constructor-based\_DI is accomplished by the container invoking a constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency. Calling a`static`factory method with specific arguments to construct the bean is nearly equivalent, and this discussion treats arguments to a constructor and to a`static`factory method similarly. The following example shows a class that can only be dependency-injected with constructor injection. Notice that there is nothing\_special\_about this class, it is a POJO that has no dependencies on container specific interfaces, base classes or annotations.

```
public class SimpleMovieLister {

    // the SimpleMovieLister has a dependency on a MovieFinder
    private MovieFinder movieFinder;

    // a constructor so that the Spring container can inject a MovieFinder
    public SimpleMovieLister(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
    }

    // business logic that actually uses the injected MovieFinder is omitted...

}
```

##### Constructor argument resolution

Constructor argument resolution matching occurs using the argument’s type. If no potential ambiguity exists in the constructor arguments of a bean definition, then the order in which the constructor arguments are defined in a bean definition is the order in which those arguments are supplied to the appropriate constructor when the bean is being instantiated. Consider the following class:

```
package x.y;

public class Foo {

    public Foo(Bar bar, Baz baz) {
        // ...
    }

}
```

No potential ambiguity exists, assuming that`Bar`and`Baz`classes are not related by inheritance. Thus the following configuration works fine, and you do not need to specify the constructor argument indexes and/or types explicitly in the`<constructor-arg/>`element.

```
<beans>
    <bean id="foo" class="x.y.Foo">
        <constructor-arg ref="bar"/>
        <constructor-arg ref="baz"/>
    </bean>

    <bean id="bar" class="x.y.Bar"/>

    <bean id="baz" class="x.y.Baz"/>
</beans>
```

When another bean is referenced, the type is known, and matching can occur \(as was the case with the preceding example\). When a simple type is used, such as`<value>true</value>`, Spring cannot determine the type of the value, and so cannot match by type without help. Consider the following class:

```
package examples;

public class ExampleBean {

    // Number of years to calculate the Ultimate Answer
    private int years;

    // The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything
    private String ultimateAnswer;

    public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {
        this.years = years;
        this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;
    }

}
```

In the preceding scenario, the container\_can\_use type matching with simple types if you explicitly specify the type of the constructor argument using the`type`attribute. For example:

```
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg type="int" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="42"/>
</bean>
```

Use the`index`attribute to specify explicitly the index of constructor arguments. For example:

```
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg index="0" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg index="1" value="42"/>
</bean>
```

In addition to resolving the ambiguity of multiple simple values, specifying an index resolves ambiguity where a constructor has two arguments of the same type. Note that the_index is 0 based_.

You can also use the constructor parameter name for value disambiguation:

```
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <constructor-arg name="years" value="7500000"/>
    <constructor-arg name="ultimateAnswer" value="42"/>
</bean>
```

Keep in mind that to make this work out of the box your code must be compiled with the debug flag enabled so that Spring can look up the parameter name from the constructor. If you can’t compile your code with debug flag \(or don’t want to\) you can use[@ConstructorProperties](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/beans/ConstructorProperties.html)JDK annotation to explicitly name your constructor arguments. The sample class would then have to look as follows:

```
package examples;

public class ExampleBean {

    // Fields omitted

    @ConstructorProperties({"years", "ultimateAnswer"})
    public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {
        this.years = years;
        this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;
    }

}
```

#### Setter-based dependency injection

\_Setter-based\_DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument`static`factory method to instantiate your bean.

The following example shows a class that can only be dependency-injected using pure setter injection. This class is conventional Java. It is a POJO that has no dependencies on container specific interfaces, base classes or annotations.

```
public class SimpleMovieLister {

    // the SimpleMovieLister has a dependency on the MovieFinder
    private MovieFinder movieFinder;

    // a setter method so that the Spring container can inject a MovieFinder
    public void setMovieFinder(MovieFinder movieFinder) {
        this.movieFinder = movieFinder;
    }

    // business logic that actually uses the injected MovieFinder is omitted...

}
```

The`ApplicationContext`supports constructor-based and setter-based DI for the beans it manages. It also supports setter-based DI after some dependencies have already been injected through the constructor approach. You configure the dependencies in the form of a`BeanDefinition`, which you use in conjunction with`PropertyEditor`instances to convert properties from one format to another. However, most Spring users do not work with these classes directly \(i.e., programmatically\) but rather with XML`bean`definitions, annotated components \(i.e., classes annotated with`@Component`,`@Controller`, etc.\), or`@Bean`methods in Java-based`@Configuration`classes. These sources are then converted internally into instances of`BeanDefinition`and used to load an entire Spring IoC container instance.

**Constructor-based or setter-based DI?**

Since you can mix constructor-based and setter-based DI, it is a good rule of thumb to use constructors for_mandatory dependencies\_and setter methods or configuration methods for\_optional dependencies_. Note that use of the[@Required](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-required-annotation)annotation on a setter method can be used to make the property a required dependency.

The Spring team generally advocates constructor injection as it enables one to implement application components as_immutable objects\_and to ensure that required dependencies are not_`null`_. Furthermore constructor-injected components are always returned to client \(calling\) code in a fully initialized state. As a side note, a large number of constructor arguments is a\_bad code smell_, implying that the class likely has too many responsibilities and should be refactored to better address proper separation of concerns.

Setter injection should primarily only be used for optional dependencies that can be assigned reasonable default values within the class. Otherwise, not-null checks must be performed everywhere the code uses the dependency. One benefit of setter injection is that setter methods make objects of that class amenable to reconfiguration or re-injection later. Management through[JMX MBeans](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#jmx)is therefore a compelling use case for setter injection.

Use the DI style that makes the most sense for a particular class. Sometimes, when dealing with third-party classes for which you do not have the source, the choice is made for you. For example, if a third-party class does not expose any setter methods, then constructor injection may be the only available form of DI.

#### Dependency resolution process

The container performs bean dependency resolution as follows:

* The`ApplicationContext`is created and initialized with configuration metadata that describes all the beans. Configuration metadata can be specified via XML, Java code, or annotations.
* For each bean, its dependencies are expressed in the form of properties, constructor arguments, or arguments to the static-factory method if you are using that instead of a normal constructor. These dependencies are provided to the bean, _when the bean is actually created_.
* Each property or constructor argument is an actual definition of the value to set, or a reference to another bean in the container.
* Each property or constructor argument which is a value is converted from its specified format to the actual type of that property or constructor argument. By default Spring can convert a value supplied in string format to all built-in types, such as
  `int`,`long`,`String`,`boolean`, etc.

The Spring container validates the configuration of each bean as the container is created. However, the bean properties themselves are not set until the bean_is actually created_. Beans that are singleton-scoped and set to be pre-instantiated \(the default\) are created when the container is created. Scopes are defined in[Section 7.5, “Bean scopes”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes). Otherwise, the bean is created only when it is requested. Creation of a bean potentially causes a graph of beans to be created, as the bean’s dependencies and its dependencies' dependencies \(and so on\) are created and assigned. Note that resolution mismatches among those dependencies may show up late, i.e. on first creation of the affected bean.

**Circular dependencies**

If you use predominantly constructor injection, it is possible to create an unresolvable circular dependency scenario.

For example: Class A requires an instance of class B through constructor injection, and class B requires an instance of class A through constructor injection. If you configure beans for classes A and B to be injected into each other, the Spring IoC container detects this circular reference at runtime, and throws a`BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`.

One possible solution is to edit the source code of some classes to be configured by setters rather than constructors. Alternatively, avoid constructor injection and use setter injection only. In other words, although it is not recommended, you can configure circular dependencies with setter injection.

Unlike the\_typical\_case \(with no circular dependencies\), a circular dependency between bean A and bean B forces one of the beans to be injected into the other prior to being fully initialized itself \(a classic chicken/egg scenario\).

You can generally trust Spring to do the right thing. It detects configuration problems, such as references to non-existent beans and circular dependencies, at container load-time. Spring sets properties and resolves dependencies as late as possible, when the bean is actually created. This means that a Spring container which has loaded correctly can later generate an exception when you request an object if there is a problem creating that object or one of its dependencies. For example, the bean throws an exception as a result of a missing or invalid property. This potentially delayed visibility of some configuration issues is why`ApplicationContext`implementations by default pre-instantiate singleton beans. At the cost of some upfront time and memory to create these beans before they are actually needed, you discover configuration issues when the`ApplicationContext`is created, not later. You can still override this default behavior so that singleton beans will lazy-initialize, rather than be pre-instantiated.

If no circular dependencies exist, when one or more collaborating beans are being injected into a dependent bean, each collaborating bean is\_totally\_configured prior to being injected into the dependent bean. This means that if bean A has a dependency on bean B, the Spring IoC container completely configures bean B prior to invoking the setter method on bean A. In other words, the bean is instantiated \(if not a pre-instantiated singleton\), its dependencies are set, and the relevant lifecycle methods \(such as a[configured init method](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean)or the[InitializingBean callback method](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean)\) are invoked.

#### Examples of dependency injection

The following example uses XML-based configuration metadata for setter-based DI. A small part of a Spring XML configuration file specifies some bean definitions:

```
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <!-- setter injection using the nested ref element -->
    <property name="beanOne">
        <ref bean="anotherExampleBean"/>
    </property>

    <!-- setter injection using the neater ref attribute -->
    <property name="beanTwo" ref="yetAnotherBean"/>
    <property name="integerProperty" value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

```
public class ExampleBean {

    private AnotherBean beanOne;
    private YetAnotherBean beanTwo;
    private int i;

    public void setBeanOne(AnotherBean beanOne) {
        this.beanOne = beanOne;
    }

    public void setBeanTwo(YetAnotherBean beanTwo) {
        this.beanTwo = beanTwo;
    }

    public void setIntegerProperty(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }

}
```

In the preceding example, setters are declared to match against the properties specified in the XML file. The following example uses constructor-based DI:

```
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean">
    <!-- constructor injection using the nested ref element -->
    <constructor-arg>
        <ref bean="anotherExampleBean"/>
    </constructor-arg>

    <!-- constructor injection using the neater ref attribute -->
    <constructor-arg ref="yetAnotherBean"/>

    <constructor-arg type="int" value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

```
public class ExampleBean {

    private AnotherBean beanOne;
    private YetAnotherBean beanTwo;
    private int i;

    public ExampleBean(
        AnotherBean anotherBean, YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean, int i) {
        this.beanOne = anotherBean;
        this.beanTwo = yetAnotherBean;
        this.i = i;
    }

}
```

The constructor arguments specified in the bean definition will be used as arguments to the constructor of the`ExampleBean`.

Now consider a variant of this example, where instead of using a constructor, Spring is told to call a`static`factory method to return an instance of the object:

```
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean" factory-method="createInstance">
    <constructor-arg ref="anotherExampleBean"/>
    <constructor-arg ref="yetAnotherBean"/>
    <constructor-arg value="1"/>
</bean>

<bean id="anotherExampleBean" class="examples.AnotherBean"/>
<bean id="yetAnotherBean" class="examples.YetAnotherBean"/>
```

```
public class ExampleBean {

    // a private constructor
    private ExampleBean(...) {
        ...
    }

    // a static factory method; the arguments to this method can be
    // considered the dependencies of the bean that is returned,
    // regardless of how those arguments are actually used.
    public static ExampleBean createInstance (
        AnotherBean anotherBean, YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean, int i) {

        ExampleBean eb = new ExampleBean (...);
        // some other operations...
        return eb;
    }

}
```

Arguments to the`static`factory method are supplied via`<constructor-arg/>`elements, exactly the same as if a constructor had actually been used. The type of the class being returned by the factory method does not have to be of the same type as the class that contains the`static`factory method, although in this example it is. An instance \(non-static\) factory method would be used in an essentially identical fashion \(aside from the use of the`factory-bean`attribute instead of the`class`attribute\), so details will not be discussed here.
