## 7.1 Introduction to the Spring IoC container and beans

This chapter covers the Spring Framework implementation of the Inversion of Control \(IoC\)[\[1\]](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#ftn.d5e1827)principle. IoC is also known as_dependency injection_\(DI\). It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies, that is, the other objects they work with, only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then_injects_those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse, hence the name_Inversion of Control_\(IoC\), of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes, or a mechanism such as the_Service Locator_pattern.

The`org.springframework.beans`and`org.springframework.context`packages are the basis for Spring Framework’s IoC container. The[`BeanFactory`](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.3.11.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanFactory.html)interface provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object.[`ApplicationContext`](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.3.11.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContext.html)is a sub-interface of`BeanFactory`. It adds easier integration with Spring’s AOP features; message resource handling \(for use in internationalization\), event publication; and application-layer specific contexts such as the`WebApplicationContext`for use in web applications.

In short, the`BeanFactory`provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, and the`ApplicationContext`adds more enterprise-specific functionality. The`ApplicationContext`is a complete superset of the`BeanFactory`, and is used exclusively in this chapter in descriptions of Spring’s IoC container. For more information on using the`BeanFactory`instead of the`ApplicationContext,`refer to[Section 7.16, “The BeanFactory”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-beanfactory).

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC_container_are called_beans_. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the_dependencies_among them, are reflected in the_configuration metadata_used by a container.
