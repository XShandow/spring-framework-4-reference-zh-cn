### 7.11.3 Limitations of JSR-330 standard annotations

When working with standard annotations, it is important to know that some significant features are not available as shown in the table below:



**Table 7.6. Spring component model elements vs. JSR-330 variants**

| Spring | javax.inject.\* | javax.inject restrictions / comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| @Autowired | @Inject | `@Inject`has no 'required' attribute; can be used with Java 8’s`Optional`instead. |
| @Component | @Named / @ManagedBean | JSR-330 does not provide a composable model, just a way to identify named components. |
| @Scope\("singleton"\) | @Singleton | The JSR-330 default scope is like Spring’s`prototype`. However, in order to keep it consistent with Spring’s general defaults, a JSR-330 bean declared in the Spring container is a`singleton`by default. In order to use a scope other than`singleton`, you should use Spring’s`@Scope`annotation.`javax.inject`also provides a[@Scope](http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Scope.html)annotation. Nevertheless, this one is only intended to be used for creating your own annotations. |
| @Qualifier | @Qualifier / @Named | `javax.inject.Qualifier`is just a meta-annotation for building custom qualifiers. Concrete String qualifiers \(like Spring’s`@Qualifier`with a value\) can be associated through`javax.inject.Named`. |
| @Value | - | no equivalent |
| @Required | - | no equivalent |
| @Lazy | - | no equivalent |
| ObjectFactory | Provider | `javax.inject.Provider`is a direct alternative to Spring’s`ObjectFactory`, just with a shorter`get()`method name. It can also be used in combination with Spring’s`@Autowired`or with non-annotated constructors and setter methods. |
