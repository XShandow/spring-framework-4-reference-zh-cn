### 7.5.1 The singleton scope

Only one_shared_instance of a singleton bean is managed, and all requests for beans with an id or ids matching that bean definition result in that one specific bean instance being returned by the Spring container.

To put it another way, when you define a bean definition and it is scoped as a singleton, the Spring IoC container creates_exactly one_instance of the object defined by that bean definition. This single instance is stored in a cache of such singleton beans, and_all subsequent requests and references_for that named bean return the cached object.

Spring’s concept of a singleton bean differs from the Singleton pattern as defined in the Gang of Four \(GoF\) patterns book. The GoF Singleton hard-codes the scope of an object such that one_and only one_instance of a particular class is created_per ClassLoader_. The scope of the Spring singleton is best described as_per container and per bean_. This means that if you define one bean for a particular class in a single Spring container, then the Spring container creates one_and only one_instance of the class defined by that bean definition._The singleton scope is the default scope in Spring_. To define a bean as a singleton in XML, you would write, for example:

```
<
bean
id
=
"accountService"
class
=
"com.foo.DefaultAccountService"
/
>
<
!-- the following is equivalent, though redundant (singleton scope is the default) --
>
<
bean
id
=
"accountService"
class
=
"com.foo.DefaultAccountService"
scope
=
"singleton"
/
>
```
