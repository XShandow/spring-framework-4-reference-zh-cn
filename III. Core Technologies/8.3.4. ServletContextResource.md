### 8.3.4 ServletContextResource

This is a`Resource`implementation for`ServletContext`resources, interpreting relative paths within the relevant web application’s root directory.

This always supports stream access and URL access, but only allows`java.io.File`access when the web application archive is expanded and the resource is physically on the filesystem. Whether or not it’s expanded and on the filesystem like this, or accessed directly from the JAR or somewhere else like a DB \(it’s conceivable\) is actually dependent on the Servlet container.
