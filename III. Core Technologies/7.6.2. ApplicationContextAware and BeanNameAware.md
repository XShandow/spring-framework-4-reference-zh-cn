### 7.6.2 ApplicationContextAware and BeanNameAware

When an`ApplicationContext`creates an object instance that implements the`org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware`interface, the instance is provided with a reference to that`ApplicationContext`.

```
public interface ApplicationContextAware {

    void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException;

}
```

Thus beans can manipulate programmatically the`ApplicationContext`that created them, through the`ApplicationContext`interface, or by casting the reference to a known subclass of this interface, such as`ConfigurableApplicationContext`, which exposes additional functionality. One use would be the programmatic retrieval of other beans. Sometimes this capability is useful; however, in general you should avoid it, because it couples the code to Spring and does not follow the Inversion of Control style, where collaborators are provided to beans as properties. Other methods of the`ApplicationContext`provide access to file resources, publishing application events, and accessing a`MessageSource`. These additional features are described in[Section 7.15, “Additional Capabilities of the ApplicationContext”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#context-introduction)

As of Spring 2.5, autowiring is another alternative to obtain reference to the`ApplicationContext`. The "traditional"`constructor`and`byType`autowiring modes \(as described in[Section 7.4.5, “Autowiring collaborators”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-autowire)\) can provide a dependency of type`ApplicationContext`for a constructor argument or setter method parameter, respectively. For more flexibility, including the ability to autowire fields and multiple parameter methods, use the new annotation-based autowiring features. If you do, the`ApplicationContext`is autowired into a field, constructor argument, or method parameter that is expecting the`ApplicationContext`type if the field, constructor, or method in question carries the`@Autowired`annotation. For more information, see[Section 7.9.2, “@Autowired”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-autowired-annotation).

When an`ApplicationContext`creates a class that implements the`org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanNameAware`interface, the class is provided with a reference to the name defined in its associated object definition.

```
public interface BeanNameAware {

    void setBeanName(String name) throws BeansException;

}
```

The callback is invoked after population of normal bean properties but before an initialization callback such as`InitializingBean`_afterPropertiesSet_or a custom init-method.
