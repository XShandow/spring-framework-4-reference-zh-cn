## 8.5 The ResourceLoaderAware interface

The`ResourceLoaderAware`interface is a special marker interface, identifying objects that expect to be provided with a`ResourceLoader`reference.

```
public interface ResourceLoaderAware {

    void setResourceLoader(ResourceLoader resourceLoader);
}
```

When a class implements`ResourceLoaderAware`and is deployed into an application context \(as a Spring-managed bean\), it is recognized as`ResourceLoaderAware`by the application context. The application context will then invoke the`setResourceLoader(ResourceLoader)`, supplying itself as the argument \(remember, all application contexts in Spring implement the`ResourceLoader`interface\).

Of course, since an`ApplicationContext`is a`ResourceLoader`, the bean could also implement the`ApplicationContextAware`interface and use the supplied application context directly to load resources, but in general, it’s better to use the specialized`ResourceLoader`interface if that’s all that’s needed. The code would just be coupled to the resource loading interface, which can be considered a utility interface, and not the whole Spring`ApplicationContext`interface.

As of Spring 2.5, you can rely upon autowiring of the`ResourceLoader`as an alternative to implementing the`ResourceLoaderAware`interface. The "traditional"`constructor`and`byType`autowiring modes \(as described in[Section 7.4.5, “Autowiring collaborators”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.11.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-autowire)\) are now capable of providing a dependency of type`ResourceLoader`for either a constructor argument or setter method parameter respectively. For more flexibility \(including the ability to autowire fields and multiple parameter methods\), consider using the new annotation-based autowiring features. In that case, the`ResourceLoader`will be autowired into a field, constructor argument, or method parameter that is expecting the`ResourceLoader`type as long as the field, constructor, or method in question carries the`@Autowired`annotation. For more information, see[Section 7.9.2, “@Autowired”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.11.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-autowired-annotation).
