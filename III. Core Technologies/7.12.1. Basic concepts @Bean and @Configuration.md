### 7.12.1 Basic concepts: @Bean and @Configuration

The central artifacts in Spring’s new Java-configuration support are`@Configuration`-annotated classes and`@Bean`-annotated methods.

The`@Bean`annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures and initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container. For those familiar with Spring’s`<beans/>`XML configuration the`@Bean`annotation plays the same role as the`<bean/>`element. You can use`@Bean`annotated methods with any Spring`@Component`, however, they are most often used with`@Configuration`beans.

Annotating a class with`@Configuration`indicates that its primary purpose is as a source of bean definitions. Furthermore,`@Configuration`classes allow inter-bean dependencies to be defined by simply calling other`@Bean`methods in the same class. The simplest possible`@Configuration`class would read as follows:

```
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }

}
```

The`AppConfig`class above would be equivalent to the following Spring`<beans/>`XML:

```
<beans>
    <bean id="myService" class="com.acme.services.MyServiceImpl"/>
</beans>
```

**Full @Configuration vs 'lite' @Beans mode?**

When`@Bean`methods are declared within classes that are_not_annotated with`@Configuration`they are referred to as being processed in a 'lite' mode. For example, bean methods declared in a`@Component`or even in a_plain old class_will be considered 'lite'.

Unlike full`@Configuration`, lite`@Bean`methods cannot easily declare inter-bean dependencies. Usually one`@Bean`method should not invoke another`@Bean`method when operating in 'lite' mode.

Only using`@Bean`methods within`@Configuration`classes is a recommended approach of ensuring that 'full' mode is always used. This will prevent the same`@Bean`method from accidentally being invoked multiple times and helps to reduce subtle bugs that can be hard to track down when operating in 'lite' mode.

The`@Bean`and`@Configuration`annotations will be discussed in depth in the sections below. First, however, we’ll cover the various ways of creating a spring container using Java-based configuration.
