# Part III. Core Technologies
Part III. 核心技术

This part of the reference documentation covers all of those technologies that are absolutely integral to the Spring Framework.
该部分的参考文档涵盖了Spring Framework中所有绝对不可或缺的技术。

Foremost amongst these is the Spring Framework’s Inversion of Control \(IoC\) container. A thorough treatment of the Spring Framework’s IoC container is closely followed by comprehensive coverage of Spring’s Aspect-Oriented Programming \(AOP\) technologies. The Spring Framework has its own AOP framework, which is conceptually easy to understand, and which successfully addresses the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements in Java enterprise programming.

Coverage of Spring’s integration with AspectJ \(currently the richest - in terms of features - and certainly most mature AOP implementation in the Java enterprise space\) is also provided.
