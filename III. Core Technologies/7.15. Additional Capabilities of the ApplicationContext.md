## 7.15Â Additional Capabilities of the ApplicationContext

As was discussed in the chapter introduction, the`org.springframework.beans.factory`package provides basic functionality for managing and manipulating beans, including in a programmatic way. The`org.springframework.context`package adds the[`ApplicationContext`](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.3.11.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContext.html)interface, which extends the`BeanFactory`interface, in addition to extending other interfaces to provide additional functionality in a more_application framework-oriented style_. Many people use the`ApplicationContext`in a completely declarative fashion, not even creating it programmatically, but instead relying on support classes such as`ContextLoader`to automatically instantiate an`ApplicationContext`as part of the normal startup process of a Java EE web application.

To enhance`BeanFactory`functionality in a more framework-oriented style the context package also provides the following functionality:

* _Access to messages in i18n-style_, through the`MessageSource`interface.
* _Access to resources_, such as URLs and files, through the`ResourceLoader`interface.
* _Event publication _to namely beans implementing the`ApplicationListener`interface, through the use of the`ApplicationEventPublisher`interface.
* _Loading of multiple \(hierarchical\) contexts_, allowing each to be focused on one particular layer, such as the web layer of an application, through the`HierarchicalBeanFactory`interface.
