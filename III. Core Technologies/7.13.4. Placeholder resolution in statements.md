### 7.13.4 Placeholder resolution in statements
在声明中的占位符

Historically, the value of placeholders in elements could be resolved only against JVM system properties or environment variables. No longer is this the case. Because the Environment abstraction is integrated throughout the container, it’s easy to route resolution of placeholders through it. This means that you may configure the resolution process in any way you like: change the precedence of searching through system properties and environment variables, or remove them entirely; add your own property sources to the mix as appropriate.
历史上说，在元素中占位符的值可以通过JVM系统参数或环境变量来处理。不再是这样的。因为环境抽象已经集成在容器，可以更加容器的处理占位符。这意味着你可以配置处理方式根据你的需要：改变查找的优先级或移除他们、添加你自己的属性源码来混合使用。

Concretely, the following statement works regardless of where the`customer`property is defined, as long as it is available in the`Environment`:
具体的，下面的声明可以作为一个自定义的属性来定义，并且在容器中有效：

```
<beans>
    <import resource="com/bank/service/${customer}-config.xml"/>
</beans>
```
