### 7.13.4 Placeholder resolution in statements

Historically, the value of placeholders in elements could be resolved only against JVM system properties or environment variables. No longer is this the case. Because the Environment abstraction is integrated throughout the container, it’s easy to route resolution of placeholders through it. This means that you may configure the resolution process in any way you like: change the precedence of searching through system properties and environment variables, or remove them entirely; add your own property sources to the mix as appropriate.

Concretely, the following statement works regardless of where the`customer`property is defined, as long as it is available in the`Environment`:

```
<
beans
>
<
import
resource
=
"com/bank/service/${customer}-config.xml"
/
>
<
/beans
>
```
