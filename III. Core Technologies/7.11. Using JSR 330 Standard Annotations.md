## 7.11Â Using JSR 330 Standard Annotations

Starting with Spring 3.0, Spring offers support for JSR-330 standard annotations \(Dependency Injection\). Those annotations are scanned in the same way as the Spring annotations. You just need to have the relevant jars in your classpath.

> If you are using Maven, the`javax.inject`artifact is available in the standard Maven repository \([http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax/inject/javax.inject/1/](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax/inject/javax.inject/1/)\). You can add the following dependency to your file pom.xml:


```
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.inject</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.inject</artifactId>
    <version>1</version>
</dependency>
```
