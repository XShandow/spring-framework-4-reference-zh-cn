## 7.4 Dependencies

依赖

A typical enterprise application does not consist of a single object \(or bean in the Spring parlance\). Even the simplest application has a few objects that work together to present what the end-user sees as a coherent application. This next section explains how you go from defining a number of bean definitions that stand alone to a fully realized application where objects collaborate to achieve a goal.  
一个典型的企业应用不可能只包含单一的object（或者bean在spring中）。甚至是最简单的应用都有几个object一起工作使得终端用户得到一个一致的应用。下一部分将解释开发者如何从仅仅定义单独的Bean，到让这些Bean在一个应用中协同工作。
