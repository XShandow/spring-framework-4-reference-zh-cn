## 7.3 Bean overview

A Spring IoC container manages one or more_beans_. These beans are created with the configuration metadata that you supply to the container, for example, in the form of XML`<bean/>`definitions.

Within the container itself, these bean definitions are represented as`BeanDefinition`objects, which contain \(among other information\) the following metadata:

* _A package-qualified class name: _typically the actual implementation class of the bean being defined.
* Bean behavioral configuration elements, which state how the bean should behave in the container \(scope, lifecycle callbacks, and so forth\).
* References to other beans that are needed for the bean to do its work; these references are also called _collaborators _or _dependencies_.
* Other configuration settings to set in the newly created object, for example, the number of connections to use in a bean that manages a connection pool, or the size limit of the pool.

This metadata translates to a set of properties that make up each bean definition.

In addition to bean definitions that contain information on how to create a specific bean, the`ApplicationContext`implementations also permit the registration of existing objects that are created outside the container, by users. This is done by accessing the ApplicationContext’s BeanFactory via the method`getBeanFactory()`which returns the BeanFactory implementation`DefaultListableBeanFactory`.`DefaultListableBeanFactory`supports this registration through the methods`registerSingleton(..)`and`registerBeanDefinition(..)`. However, typical applications work solely with beans defined through metadata bean definitions.


> Bean metadata and manually supplied singleton instances need to be registered as early as possible, in order for the container to properly reason about them during autowiring and other introspection steps. While overriding of existing metadata and existing singleton instances is supported to some degree, the registration of new beans at runtime \(concurrently with live access to factory\) is not officially supported and may lead to concurrent access exceptions and/or inconsistent state in the bean container. |
