### 8.7.3Â FileSystemResource caveats

A`FileSystemResource`that is not attached to a`FileSystemApplicationContext`\(that is, a`FileSystemApplicationContext`is not the actual`ResourceLoader`\) will treat absolute vs. relative paths as you would expect. Relative paths are relative to the current working directory, while absolute paths are relative to the root of the filesystem.

For backwards compatibility \(historical\) reasons however, this changes when the`FileSystemApplicationContext`is the`ResourceLoader`. The`FileSystemApplicationContext`simply forces all attached`FileSystemResource`instances to treat all location paths as relative, whether they start with a leading slash or not. In practice, this means the following are equivalent:

```
ApplicationContext ctx =
    new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("conf/context.xml");
```

```
ApplicationContext ctx =
    new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("/conf/context.xml");
```

As are the following: \(Even though it would make sense for them to be different, as one case is relative and the other absolute.\)

```
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext ctx = ...;
ctx.getResource("some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
```

```
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext ctx = ...;
ctx.getResource("/some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
```

In practice, if true absolute filesystem paths are needed, it is better to forgo the use of absolute paths with`FileSystemResource`/`FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`, and just force the use of a`UrlResource`, by using the`file:`URL prefix.

```
// actual context type doesn't matter, the Resource will always be UrlResource
ctx.getResource("file:///some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
```

```
// force this FileSystemXmlApplicationContext to load its definition via a UrlResource
ApplicationContext ctx =
    new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("file:///conf/context.xml");
```
