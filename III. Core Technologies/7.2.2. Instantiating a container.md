### 7.2.2 Instantiating a container

Instantiating a Spring IoC container is straightforward. The location path or paths supplied to an`ApplicationContext`constructor are actually resource strings that allow the container to load configuration metadata from a variety of external resources such as the local file system, from the Java`CLASSPATH`, and so on.

```
ApplicationContext context =
    new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(new String[] {"services.xml", "daos.xml"});
```


> After you learn about Spring’s IoC container, you may want to know more about Spring’s`Resource`abstraction, as described in[Chapter 8,Resources](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#resources), which provides a convenient mechanism for reading an InputStream from locations defined in a URI syntax. In particular,`Resource`paths are used to construct applications contexts as described in[Section 8.7, “Application contexts and Resource paths”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#resources-app-ctx). 

The following example shows the service layer objects`(services.xml)`configuration file:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- services -->

    <bean id="petStore" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.services.PetStoreServiceImpl">
        <property name="accountDao" ref="accountDao"/>
        <property name="itemDao" ref="itemDao"/>
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions for services go here -->

</beans>
```

The following example shows the data access objects`daos.xml`file:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="accountDao"
        class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaAccountDao">
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="itemDao" class="org.springframework.samples.jpetstore.dao.jpa.JpaItemDao">
        <!-- additional collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions for data access objects go here -->

</beans>
```

In the preceding example, the service layer consists of the class`PetStoreServiceImpl`, and two data access objects of the type`JpaAccountDao`and`JpaItemDao`\(based on the JPA Object/Relational mapping standard\). The`property name`element refers to the name of the JavaBean property, and the`ref`element refers to the name of another bean definition. This linkage between`id`and`ref`elements expresses the dependency between collaborating objects. For details of configuring an object’s dependencies, see[Dependencies](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-dependencies).

#### Composing XML-based configuration metadata

It can be useful to have bean definitions span multiple XML files. Often each individual XML configuration file represents a logical layer or module in your architecture.

You can use the application context constructor to load bean definitions from all these XML fragments. This constructor takes multiple`Resource`locations, as was shown in the previous section. Alternatively, use one or more occurrences of the`<import/>`element to load bean definitions from another file or files. For example:

```
<
beans
>
<
import
resource
=
"services.xml"
/
>
<
import
resource
=
"resources/messageSource.xml"
/
>
<
import
resource
=
"/resources/themeSource.xml"
/
>
<
bean
id
=
"bean1"
class
=
"..."
/
>
<
bean
id
=
"bean2"
class
=
"..."
/
>
<
/beans
>
```

In the preceding example, external bean definitions are loaded from three files:`services.xml`,`messageSource.xml`, and`themeSource.xml`. All location paths are relative to the definition file doing the importing, so`services.xml`must be in the same directory or classpath location as the file doing the importing, while`messageSource.xml`and`themeSource.xml`must be in a`resources`location below the location of the importing file. As you can see, a leading slash is ignored, but given that these paths are relative, it is better form not to use the slash at all. The contents of the files being imported, including the top level`<beans/>`element, must be valid XML bean definitions according to the Spring Schema.

| It is possible, but not recommended, to reference files in parent directories using a relative "../" path. Doing so creates a dependency on a file that is outside the current application. In particular, this reference is not recommended for "classpath:" URLs \(for example, "classpath:../services.xml"\), where the runtime resolution process chooses the "nearest" classpath root and then looks into its parent directory. Classpath configuration changes may lead to the choice of a different, incorrect directory.You can always use fully qualified resource locations instead of relative paths: for example, "file:C:/config/services.xml" or "classpath:/config/services.xml". However, be aware that you are coupling your application’s configuration to specific absolute locations. It is generally preferable to keep an indirection for such absolute locations, for example, through "${…​}" placeholders that are resolved against JVM system properties at runtime. |

The import directive is a feature provided by the beans namespace itself. Further configuration features beyond plain bean definitions are available in a selection of XML namespaces provided by Spring, e.g. the "context" and the "util" namespace.

#### The Groovy Bean Definition DSL

As a further example for externalized configuration metadata, bean definitions can also be expressed in Spring’s Groovy Bean Definition DSL, as known from the Grails framework. Typically, such configuration will live in a ".groovy" file with a structure as follows:

```
beans {
    dataSource(BasicDataSource) {
        driverClassName = 
"org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"

        url = 
"jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"

        username = 
"sa"

        password = 
""

        settings = [mynew:
"setting"
]
    }
    sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {
        dataSource = dataSource
    }
    myService(MyService) {
        nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean -
>

            dataSource = dataSource
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration style is largely equivalent to XML bean definitions and even supports Spring’s XML configuration namespaces. It also allows for importing XML bean definition files through an "importBeans" directive.
