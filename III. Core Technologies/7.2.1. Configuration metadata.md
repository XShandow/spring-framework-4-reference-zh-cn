### 7.2.1 Configuration metadata
配置元数据

As the preceding diagram shows, the Spring IoC container consumes a form of_configuration metadata_; this configuration metadata represents how you as an application developer tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.
如上述图所示，Spring IoC 容器使用 配置元数据（ configuration metadata）;这个配置元数据代表了应用程序开发人员告诉 Spring 容器在应用程序中如何来实例化，配置和组装对象。

Configuration metadata is traditionally supplied in a simple and intuitive XML format, which is what most of this chapter uses to convey key concepts and features of the Spring IoC container.


> XML-based metadata is_not_the only allowed form of configuration metadata. The Spring IoC container itself is_totally_decoupled from the format in which this configuration metadata is actually written. These days many developers choose[Java-based configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-java)for their Spring applications. 


For information about using other forms of metadata with the Spring container, see:


* [Annotation-based configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-annotation-config): Spring 2.5 introduced support for annotation-based configuration metadata.

* [Java-based configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-java): Starting with Spring 3.0, many features provided by the Spring JavaConfig project became part of the core Spring Framework. Thus you can define beans external to your application classes by using Java rather than XML files. To use these new features, see the`@Configuration`,`@Bean`,`@Import`and`@DependsOn`annotations.


Spring configuration consists of at least one and typically more than one bean definition that the container must manage. XML-based configuration metadata shows these beans configured as`<bean/>`elements inside a top-level`<beans/>`element. Java configuration typically uses`@Bean`annotated methods within a`@Configuration`class.


These bean definitions correspond to the actual objects that make up your application. Typically you define service layer objects, data access objects \(DAOs\), presentation objects such as Struts`Action`instances, infrastructure objects such as Hibernate`SessionFactories`, JMS`Queues`, and so forth. Typically one does not configure fine-grained domain objects in the container, because it is usually the responsibility of DAOs and business logic to create and load domain objects. However, you can use Spring’s integration with AspectJ to configure objects that have been created outside the control of an IoC container. See[Using AspectJ to dependency-inject domain objects with Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#aop-atconfigurable).


The following example shows the basic structure of XML-based configuration metadata:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="..." class="...">
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <bean id="..." class="...">
        <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
    </bean>

    <!-- more bean definitions go here -->

</beans>
```

The`id`attribute is a string that you use to identify the individual bean definition. The`class`attribute defines the type of the bean and uses the fully qualified classname. The value of the id attribute refers to collaborating objects. The XML for referring to collaborating objects is not shown in this example; see[Dependencies](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-dependencies)for more information.
