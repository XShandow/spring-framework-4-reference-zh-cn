### 7.4.4 Lazy-initialized beans

By default,`ApplicationContext`implementations eagerly create and configure all[singleton](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-singleton)beans as part of the initialization process. Generally, this pre-instantiation is desirable, because errors in the configuration or surrounding environment are discovered immediately, as opposed to hours or even days later. When this behavior is_not_desirable, you can prevent pre-instantiation of a singleton bean by marking the bean definition as lazy-initialized. A lazy-initialized bean tells the IoC container to create a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup.

In XML, this behavior is controlled by the`lazy-init`attribute on the`<bean/>`element; for example:

```
<bean id="lazy" class="com.foo.ExpensiveToCreateBean" lazy-init="true"/>
<bean name="not.lazy" class="com.foo.AnotherBean"/>
```

When the preceding configuration is consumed by an`ApplicationContext`, the bean named`lazy`is not eagerly pre-instantiated when the`ApplicationContext`is starting up, whereas the`not.lazy`bean is eagerly pre-instantiated.

However, when a lazy-initialized bean is a dependency of a singleton bean that is_not_lazy-initialized, the`ApplicationContext`creates the lazy-initialized bean at startup, because it must satisfy the singleton’s dependencies. The lazy-initialized bean is injected into a singleton bean elsewhere that is not lazy-initialized.

You can also control lazy-initialization at the container level by using the`default-lazy-init`attribute on the`<beans/>`element; for example:

```
<beans default-lazy-init="true">
    <!-- no beans will be pre-instantiated... -->
</beans>
```
