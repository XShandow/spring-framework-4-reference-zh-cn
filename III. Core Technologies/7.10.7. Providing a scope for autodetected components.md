### 7.10.7 Providing a scope for autodetected components

As with Spring-managed components in general, the default and most common scope for autodetected components is`singleton`. However, sometimes you need a different scope which can be specified via the`@Scope`annotation. Simply provide the name of the scope within the annotation:

```
@Scope("prototype")
@Repository
public class MovieFinderImpl implements MovieFinder {
    // ...
}
```

For details on web-specific scopes, see[Section 7.5.4, “Request, session, global session, application, and WebSocket scopes”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-other).

> To provide a custom strategy for scope resolution rather than relying on the annotation-based approach, implement the[`ScopeMetadataResolver`](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.3.11.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ScopeMetadataResolver.html)interface, and be sure to include a default no-arg constructor. Then, provide the fully-qualified class name when configuring the scanner: |

```
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "org.example", scopeResolver = MyScopeResolver.class)
public class AppConfig {
    ...
}
```

```
<beans>
    <context:component-scan base-package="org.example"
            scope-resolver="org.example.MyScopeResolver" />
</beans>
```

When using certain non-singleton scopes, it may be necessary to generate proxies for the scoped objects. The reasoning is described in[the section called “Scoped beans as dependencies”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-other-injection). For this purpose, a_scoped-proxy_attribute is available on the component-scan element. The three possible values are: no, interfaces, and targetClass. For example, the following configuration will result in standard JDK dynamic proxies:

```
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "org.example", scopedProxy = ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)
public class AppConfig {
    ...
}
```

```
<beans>
    <context:component-scan base-package="org.example"
        scoped-proxy="interfaces" />
</beans>
```
