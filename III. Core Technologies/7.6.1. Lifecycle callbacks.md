### 7.6.1 Lifecycle callbacks

To interact with the container’s management of the bean lifecycle, you can implement the Spring`InitializingBean`and`DisposableBean`interfaces. The container calls`afterPropertiesSet()`for the former and`destroy()`for the latter to allow the bean to perform certain actions upon initialization and destruction of your beans.

| The JSR-250`@PostConstruct`and`@PreDestroy`annotations are generally considered best practice for receiving lifecycle callbacks in a modern Spring application. Using these annotations means that your beans are not coupled to Spring specific interfaces. For details see[Section 7.9.8, “@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations).If you don’t want to use the JSR-250 annotations but you are still looking to remove coupling consider the use of init-method and destroy-method object definition metadata. |

Internally, the Spring Framework uses`BeanPostProcessor`implementations to process any callback interfaces it can find and call the appropriate methods. If you need custom features or other lifecycle behavior Spring does not offer out-of-the-box, you can implement a`BeanPostProcessor`yourself. For more information, see[Section 7.8, “Container Extension Points”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-extension).

In addition to the initialization and destruction callbacks, Spring-managed objects may also implement the`Lifecycle`interface so that those objects can participate in the startup and shutdown process as driven by the container’s own lifecycle.

The lifecycle callback interfaces are described in this section.

#### Initialization callbacks

The`org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean`interface allows a bean to perform initialization work after all necessary properties on the bean have been set by the container. The`InitializingBean`interface specifies a single method:

```
void
 afterPropertiesSet() 
throws
 Exception;
```

It is recommended that you do not use the`InitializingBean`interface because it unnecessarily couples the code to Spring. Alternatively, use the[`@PostConstruct`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations)annotation or specify a POJO initialization method. In the case of XML-based configuration metadata, you use the`init-method`attribute to specify the name of the method that has a void no-argument signature. With Java config, you use the`initMethod`attribute of`@Bean`, see[the section called “Receiving lifecycle callbacks”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-java-lifecycle-callbacks). For example, the following:

```
<
bean
id
=
"exampleInitBean"
class
=
"examples.ExampleBean"
init-method
=
"init"
/
>
```

```
public
class
 ExampleBean {


public
void
 init() {

// do some initialization work

    }

}
```

…​is exactly the same as…​

```
<
bean
id
=
"exampleInitBean"
class
=
"examples.AnotherExampleBean"
/
>
```

```
public
class
 AnotherExampleBean 
implements
 InitializingBean {


public
void
 afterPropertiesSet() {

// do some initialization work

    }

}
```

but does not couple the code to Spring.

#### Destruction callbacks

Implementing the`org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean`interface allows a bean to get a callback when the container containing it is destroyed. The`DisposableBean`interface specifies a single method:

```
void
 destroy() 
throws
 Exception;
```

It is recommended that you do not use the`DisposableBean`callback interface because it unnecessarily couples the code to Spring. Alternatively, use the[`@PreDestroy`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations)annotation or specify a generic method that is supported by bean definitions. With XML-based configuration metadata, you use the`destroy-method`attribute on the`<bean/>`. With Java config, you use the`destroyMethod`attribute of`@Bean`, see[the section called “Receiving lifecycle callbacks”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-java-lifecycle-callbacks). For example, the following definition:

```
<
bean
id
=
"exampleInitBean"
class
=
"examples.ExampleBean"
destroy-method
=
"cleanup"
/
>
```

```
public
class
 ExampleBean {


public
void
 cleanup() {

// do some destruction work (like releasing pooled connections)

    }

}
```

is exactly the same as:

```
<
bean
id
=
"exampleInitBean"
class
=
"examples.AnotherExampleBean"
/
>
```

```
public
class
 AnotherExampleBean 
implements
 DisposableBean {


public
void
 destroy() {

// do some destruction work (like releasing pooled connections)

    }

}
```

but does not couple the code to Spring.

| The`destroy-method`attribute of a`<bean>`element can be assigned a special`(inferred)`value which instructs Spring to automatically detect a public`close`or`shutdown`method on the specific bean class \(any class that implements`java.lang.AutoCloseable`or`java.io.Closeable`would therefore match\). This special`(inferred)`value can also be set on the`default-destroy-method`attribute of a`<beans>`element to apply this behavior to an entire set of beans \(see[the section called “Default initialization and destroy methods”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-lifecycle-default-init-destroy-methods)\). Note that this is the default behavior with Java config. |

#### Default initialization and destroy methods

When you write initialization and destroy method callbacks that do not use the Spring-specific`InitializingBean`and`DisposableBean`callback interfaces, you typically write methods with names such as`init()`,`initialize()`,`dispose()`, and so on. Ideally, the names of such lifecycle callback methods are standardized across a project so that all developers use the same method names and ensure consistency.

You can configure the Spring container to`look`for named initialization and destroy callback method names on\_every\_bean. This means that you, as an application developer, can write your application classes and use an initialization callback called`init()`, without having to configure an`init-method="init"`attribute with each bean definition. The Spring IoC container calls that method when the bean is created \(and in accordance with the standard lifecycle callback contract described previously\). This feature also enforces a consistent naming convention for initialization and destroy method callbacks.

Suppose that your initialization callback methods are named`init()`and destroy callback methods are named`destroy()`. Your class will resemble the class in the following example.

```
public
class
 DefaultBlogService 
implements
 BlogService {


private
 BlogDao blogDao;


public
void
 setBlogDao(BlogDao blogDao) {

this
.blogDao = blogDao;
    }


// this is (unsurprisingly) the initialization callback method
public
void
 init() {

if
 (
this
.blogDao == null) {

throw
new
 IllegalStateException(
"The [blogDao] property must be set."
);
        }
    }

}
```

```
<
beans
default-init-method
=
"init"
>
<
bean
id
=
"blogService"
class
=
"com.foo.DefaultBlogService"
>
<
property
name
=
"blogDao"
ref
=
"blogDao"
 /
>
<
/bean
>
<
/beans
>
```

The presence of the`default-init-method`attribute on the top-level`<beans/>`element attribute causes the Spring IoC container to recognize a method called`init`on beans as the initialization method callback. When a bean is created and assembled, if the bean class has such a method, it is invoked at the appropriate time.

You configure destroy method callbacks similarly \(in XML, that is\) by using the`default-destroy-method`attribute on the top-level`<beans/>`element.

Where existing bean classes already have callback methods that are named at variance with the convention, you can override the default by specifying \(in XML, that is\) the method name using the`init-method`and`destroy-method`attributes of the`<bean/>`itself.

The Spring container guarantees that a configured initialization callback is called immediately after a bean is supplied with all dependencies. Thus the initialization callback is called on the raw bean reference, which means that AOP interceptors and so forth are not yet applied to the bean. A target bean is fully created_first_,\_then\_an AOP proxy \(for example\) with its interceptor chain is applied. If the target bean and the proxy are defined separately, your code can even interact with the raw target bean, bypassing the proxy. Hence, it would be inconsistent to apply the interceptors to the init method, because doing so would couple the lifecycle of the target bean with its proxy/interceptors and leave strange semantics when your code interacts directly to the raw target bean.

#### Combining lifecycle mechanisms

As of Spring 2.5, you have three options for controlling bean lifecycle behavior: the[`InitializingBean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-lifecycle-initializingbean)and[`DisposableBean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-lifecycle-disposablebean)callback interfaces; custom`init()`and`destroy()`methods; and the[`@PostConstruct`and`@PreDestroy`annotations](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations). You can combine these mechanisms to control a given bean.

> If multiple lifecycle mechanisms are configured for a bean, and each mechanism is configured with a different method name, then each configured method is executed in the order listed below. However, if the same method name is configured - for example,`init()`for an initialization method - for more than one of these lifecycle mechanisms, that method is executed once, as explained in the preceding section. \|

Multiple lifecycle mechanisms configured for the same bean, with different initialization methods, are called as follows:

* Methods annotated with `@PostConstruct`
* `afterPropertiesSet()` as defined by the`InitializingBean`callback interface
* A custom configured `init()` method

Destroy methods are called in the same order:

* Methods annotated with`@PreDestroy`
* `destroy()`as defined by the`DisposableBean`callback interface
* A custom configured`destroy()`method

#### Startup and shutdown callbacks

The`Lifecycle`interface defines the essential methods for any object that has its own lifecycle requirements \(e.g. starts and stops some background process\):

```
public interface Lifecycle {

    void start();

    void stop();

    boolean isRunning();

}
```

Any Spring-managed object may implement that interface. Then, when the`ApplicationContext`itself receives start and stop signals, e.g. for a stop/restart scenario at runtime, it will cascade those calls to all`Lifecycle`implementations defined within that context. It does this by delegating to a`LifecycleProcessor`:

```
public interface LifecycleProcessor extends Lifecycle {

    void onRefresh();

    void onClose();

}
```

Notice that the`LifecycleProcessor`is itself an extension of the`Lifecycle`interface. It also adds two other methods for reacting to the context being refreshed and closed.

> Note that the regular`org.springframework.context.Lifecycle`interface is just a plain contract for explicit start/stop notifications and does NOT imply auto-startup at context refresh time. Consider implementing`org.springframework.context.SmartLifecycle`instead for fine-grained control over auto-startup of a specific bean \(including startup phases\). Also, please note that stop notifications are not guaranteed to come before destruction: On regular shutdown, all`Lifecycle`beans will first receive a stop notification before the general destruction callbacks are being propagated; however, on hot refresh during a context’s lifetime or on aborted refresh attempts, only destroy methods will be called. \|

The order of startup and shutdown invocations can be important. If a "depends-on" relationship exists between any two objects, the dependent side will start\_after\_its dependency, and it will stop\_before\_its dependency. However, at times the direct dependencies are unknown. You may only know that objects of a certain type should start prior to objects of another type. In those cases, the`SmartLifecycle`interface defines another option, namely the`getPhase()`method as defined on its super-interface,`Phased`.

```
public interface Phased {

    int getPhase();

}
```

```
public interface SmartLifecycle extends Lifecycle, Phased {

    boolean isAutoStartup();

    void stop(Runnable callback);

}
```

When starting, the objects with the lowest phase start first, and when stopping, the reverse order is followed. Therefore, an object that implements`SmartLifecycle`and whose`getPhase()`method returns`Integer.MIN_VALUE`would be among the first to start and the last to stop. At the other end of the spectrum, a phase value of`Integer.MAX_VALUE`would indicate that the object should be started last and stopped first \(likely because it depends on other processes to be running\). When considering the phase value, it’s also important to know that the default phase for any "normal"`Lifecycle`object that does not implement`SmartLifecycle`would be 0. Therefore, any negative phase value would indicate that an object should start before those standard components \(and stop after them\), and vice versa for any positive phase value.

As you can see the stop method defined by`SmartLifecycle`accepts a callback. Any implementation\_must\_invoke that callback’s`run()`method after that implementation’s shutdown process is complete. That enables asynchronous shutdown where necessary since the default implementation of the`LifecycleProcessor`interface,`DefaultLifecycleProcessor`, will wait up to its timeout value for the group of objects within each phase to invoke that callback. The default per-phase timeout is 30 seconds. You can override the default lifecycle processor instance by defining a bean named "lifecycleProcessor" within the context. If you only want to modify the timeout, then defining the following would be sufficient:

```
<bean id="lifecycleProcessor" class="org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor">
    <!-- timeout value in milliseconds -->
    <property name="timeoutPerShutdownPhase" value="10000"/>
</bean>
```

As mentioned, the`LifecycleProcessor`interface defines callback methods for the refreshing and closing of the context as well. The latter will simply drive the shutdown process as if`stop()`had been called explicitly, but it will happen when the context is closing. The 'refresh' callback on the other hand enables another feature of`SmartLifecycle`beans. When the context is refreshed \(after all objects have been instantiated and initialized\), that callback will be invoked, and at that point the default lifecycle processor will check the boolean value returned by each`SmartLifecycle`object’s`isAutoStartup()`method. If "true", then that object will be started at that point rather than waiting for an explicit invocation of the context’s or its own`start()`method \(unlike the context refresh, the context start does not happen automatically for a standard context implementation\). The "phase" value as well as any "depends-on" relationships will determine the startup order in the same way as described above.

#### Shutting down the Spring IoC container gracefully in non-web applications

> This section applies only to non-web applications. Spring’s web-based`ApplicationContext`implementations already have code in place to shut down the Spring IoC container gracefully when the relevant web application is shut down. \|

If you are using Spring’s IoC container in a non-web application environment; for example, in a rich client desktop environment; you register a shutdown hook with the JVM. Doing so ensures a graceful shutdown and calls the relevant destroy methods on your singleton beans so that all resources are released. Of course, you must still configure and implement these destroy callbacks correctly.

To register a shutdown hook, you call the`registerShutdownHook()`method that is declared on the`ConfigurableApplicationContext`interface:

```
import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public final class Boot {

    public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {

        ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
                new String []{"beans.xml"});

        // add a shutdown hook for the above context...
        ctx.registerShutdownHook();

        // app runs here...

        // main method exits, hook is called prior to the app shutting down...

    }
}
```
