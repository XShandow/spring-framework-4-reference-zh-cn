### 9.5.4Â ConversionService API

The ConversionService defines a unified API for executing type conversion logic at runtime. Converters are often executed behind this facade interface:

```
package org.springframework.core.convert;

public interface ConversionService {

    boolean canConvert(Class<?> sourceType, Class<?> targetType);

    <T> T convert(Object source, Class<T> targetType);

    boolean canConvert(TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);

    Object convert(Object source, TypeDescriptor sourceType, TypeDescriptor targetType);

}
```

Most ConversionService implementations also implement`ConverterRegistry`, which provides an SPI for registering converters. Internally, a ConversionService implementation delegates to its registered converters to carry out type conversion logic.

A robust ConversionService implementation is provided in the`core.convert.support`package.`GenericConversionService`is the general-purpose implementation suitable for use in most environments.`ConversionServiceFactory`provides a convenient factory for creating common ConversionService configurations.
