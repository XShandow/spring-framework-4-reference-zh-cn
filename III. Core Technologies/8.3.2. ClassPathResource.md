### 8.3.2Â ClassPathResource

This class represents a resource which should be obtained from the classpath. This uses either the thread context class loader, a given class loader, or a given class for loading resources.

This`Resource`implementation supports resolution as`java.io.File`if the class path resource resides in the file system, but not for classpath resources which reside in a jar and have not been expanded \(by the servlet engine, or whatever the environment is\) to the filesystem. To address this the various`Resource`implementations always support resolution as a`java.net.URL`.

A`ClassPathResource`is created by Java code explicitly using the`ClassPathResource`constructor, but will often be created implicitly when you call an API method which takes a`String`argument which is meant to represent a path. For the latter case, a JavaBeans`PropertyEditor`will recognize the special prefix`classpath:`on the string path, and create a`ClassPathResource`in that case.
