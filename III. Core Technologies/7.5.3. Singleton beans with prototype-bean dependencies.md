### 7.5.3 Singleton beans with prototype-bean dependencies

依赖原型bean的单例bean

When you use singleton-scoped beans with dependencies on prototype beans, be aware that_dependencies are resolved at instantiation time_. Thus if you dependency-inject a prototype-scoped bean into a singleton-scoped bean, a new prototype bean is instantiated and then dependency-injected into the singleton bean. The prototype instance is the sole instance that is ever supplied to the singleton-scoped bean.
当你的单例bean依赖原型bean时，要意识到是在初始化的时候被依赖注入的。如果你在单例bean中注入原型bean，一个新的原型bean实例会被初始化然后注入单例bean。原型bean只会提供一次实例给单例bean。

However, suppose you want the singleton-scoped bean to acquire a new instance of the prototype-scoped bean repeatedly at runtime. You cannot dependency-inject a prototype-scoped bean into your singleton bean, because that injection occurs only_once_, when the Spring container is instantiating the singleton bean and resolving and injecting its dependencies. If you need a new instance of a prototype bean at runtime more than once, see[Section 7.4.6, “Method injection”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-method-injection)
然而，假设你希望单例bean在每次运行时获得一个新的原型bean。你不能直接将原型bean注入单例bean，因为只会注入一次，整个注入会在spring容器初始化单例的bean的时候完成。如果你在每次运行时需要一个新的原型bean，见章节7.4.6，“方法注入”
