## 7.5 Bean scopes

When you create a bean definition, you create a_recipe_for creating actual instances of the class defined by that bean definition. The idea that a bean definition is a recipe is important, because it means that, as with a class, you can create many object instances from a single recipe.

You can control not only the various dependencies and configuration values that are to be plugged into an object that is created from a particular bean definition, but also the_scope_of the objects created from a particular bean definition. This approach is powerful and flexible in that you can_choose_the scope of the objects you create through configuration instead of having to bake in the scope of an object at the Java class level. Beans can be defined to be deployed in one of a number of scopes: out of the box, the Spring Framework supports seven scopes, five of which are available only if you use a web-aware`ApplicationContext`.

The following scopes are supported out of the box. You can also create[a custom scope.](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-custom)



**Table 7.3. Bean scopes**

| Scope | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [singleton](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-singleton) | \(Default\) Scopes a single bean definition to a single object instance per Spring IoC container. |
| [prototype](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-prototype) | Scopes a single bean definition to any number of object instances. |
| [request](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-request) | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a single HTTP request; that is, each HTTP request has its own instance of a bean created off the back of a single bean definition. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring`ApplicationContext`. |
| [session](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-session) | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of an HTTP`Session`. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring`ApplicationContext`. |
| [globalSession](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-global-session) | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a global HTTP`Session`. Typically only valid when used in a Portlet context. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring`ApplicationContext`. |
| [application](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-application) | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a`ServletContext`. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring`ApplicationContext`. |
| [websocket](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#websocket-stomp-websocket-scope) | Scopes a single bean definition to the lifecycle of a`WebSocket`. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring`ApplicationContext`. |


> As of Spring 3.0, a_thread scope_is available, but is not registered by default. For more information, see the documentation for[`SimpleThreadScope`](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.3.11.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/SimpleThreadScope.html). For instructions on how to register this or any other custom scope, see[the section called “Using a custom scope”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-scopes-custom-using). |
