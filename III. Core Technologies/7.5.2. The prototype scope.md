### 7.5.2 The prototype scope

The non-singleton, prototype scope of bean deployment results in the_creation of a new bean instance_every time a request for that specific bean is made. That is, the bean is injected into another bean or you request it through a`getBean()`method call on the container. As a rule, use the prototype scope for all stateful beans and the singleton scope for stateless beans.

The following diagram illustrates the Spring prototype scope._A data access object \(DAO\) is not typically configured as a prototype, because a typical DAO does not hold any conversational state; it was just easier for this author to reuse the core of the singleton diagram._

The following example defines a bean as a prototype in XML:

```
<bean id="accountService" class="com.foo.DefaultAccountService" scope="prototype"/>
```

In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype instance. Thus, although_initialization_lifecycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope, in the case of prototypes, configured_destruction_lifecycle callbacks are_not_called. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped objects and release expensive resources that the prototype bean\(s\) are holding. To get the Spring container to release resources held by prototype-scoped beans, try using a custom[bean post-processor](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-extension-bpp), which holds a reference to beans that need to be cleaned up.

In some respects, the Spring container’s role in regard to a prototype-scoped bean is a replacement for the Java`new`operator. All lifecycle management past that point must be handled by the client. \(For details on the lifecycle of a bean in the Spring container, see[Section 7.6.1, “Lifecycle callbacks”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-lifecycle).\)
