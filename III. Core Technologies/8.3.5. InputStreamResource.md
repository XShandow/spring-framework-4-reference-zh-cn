### 8.3.5Â InputStreamResource

A`Resource`implementation for a given`InputStream`. This should only be used if no specific`Resource`implementation is applicable. In particular, prefer`ByteArrayResource`or any of the file-based`Resource`implementations where possible.

In contrast to other`Resource`implementations, this is a descriptor for an_already_opened resource - therefore returning`true`from`isOpen()`. Do not use it if you need to keep the resource descriptor somewhere, or if you need to read a stream multiple times.
