### 7.10.1 @Component and further stereotype annotations

The`@Repository`annotation is a marker for any class that fulfills the role or_stereotype_of a repository \(also known as Data Access Object or DAO\). Among the uses of this marker is the automatic translation of exceptions as described in[Section 20.2.2, “Exception translation”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#orm-exception-translation).

Spring provides further stereotype annotations:`@Component`,`@Service`, and`@Controller`.`@Component`is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.`@Repository`,`@Service`, and`@Controller`are specializations of`@Component`for more specific use cases, for example, in the persistence, service, and presentation layers, respectively. Therefore, you can annotate your component classes with`@Component`, but by annotating them with`@Repository`,`@Service`, or`@Controller`instead, your classes are more properly suited for processing by tools or associating with aspects. For example, these stereotype annotations make ideal targets for pointcuts. It is also possible that`@Repository`,`@Service`, and`@Controller`may carry additional semantics in future releases of the Spring Framework. Thus, if you are choosing between using`@Component`or`@Service`for your service layer,`@Service`is clearly the better choice. Similarly, as stated above,`@Repository`is already supported as a marker for automatic exception translation in your persistence layer.
