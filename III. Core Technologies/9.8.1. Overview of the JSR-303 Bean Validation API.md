### 9.8.1Â Overview of the JSR-303 Bean Validation API

JSR-303 standardizes validation constraint declaration and metadata for the Java platform. Using this API, you annotate domain model properties with declarative validation constraints and the runtime enforces them. There are a number of built-in constraints you can take advantage of. You may also define your own custom constraints.

To illustrate, consider a simple PersonForm model with two properties:

```
public class PersonForm {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```

JSR-303 allows you to define declarative validation constraints against such properties:

```
public class PersonForm {

    @NotNull
    @Size(max=64)
    private String name;

    @Min(0)
    private int age;

}
```

When an instance of this class is validated by a JSR-303 Validator, these constraints will be enforced.

For general information on JSR-303/JSR-349, see the[Bean Validation website](http://beanvalidation.org/). For information on the specific capabilities of the default reference implementation, see the[Hibernate Validator](https://www.hibernate.org/412.html)documentation.
