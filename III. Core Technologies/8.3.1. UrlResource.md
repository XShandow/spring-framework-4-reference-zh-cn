### 8.3.1 UrlResource

The`UrlResource`wraps a`java.net.URL`, and may be used to access any object that is normally accessible via a URL, such as files, an HTTP target, an FTP target, etc. All URLs have a standardized`String`representation, such that appropriate standardized prefixes are used to indicate one URL type from another. This includes`file:`for accessing filesystem paths,`http:`for accessing resources via the HTTP protocol,`ftp:`for accessing resources via FTP, etc.

A`UrlResource`is created by Java code explicitly using the`UrlResource`constructor, but will often be created implicitly when you call an API method which takes a`String`argument which is meant to represent a path. For the latter case, a JavaBeans`PropertyEditor`will ultimately decide which type of`Resource`to create. If the path string contains a few well-known \(to it, that is\) prefixes such as`classpath:`, it will create an appropriate specialized`Resource`for that prefix. However, if it doesn’t recognize the prefix, it will assume the this is just a standard URL string, and will create a`UrlResource`.
