### 9.5.1Â Converter SPI

The SPI to implement type conversion logic is simple and strongly typed:

```
package org.springframework.core.convert.converter;

public interface Converter<S, T> {

    T convert(S source);

}
```

To create your own converter, simply implement the interface above. Parameterize`S`as the type you are converting from, and`T`as the type you are converting to. Such a converter can also be applied transparently if a collection or array of`S`needs to be converted to an array or collection of`T`, provided that a delegating array/collection converter has been registered as well \(which`DefaultConversionService`does by default\).

For each call to`convert(S)`, the source argument is guaranteed to be NOT null. Your Converter may throw any unchecked exception if conversion fails; specifically, an`IllegalArgumentException`should be thrown to report an invalid source value. Take care to ensure that your`Converter`implementation is thread-safe.

Several converter implementations are provided in the`core.convert.support`package as a convenience. These include converters from Strings to Numbers and other common types. Consider`StringToInteger`as an example for a typical`Converter`implementation:

```
package org.springframework.core.convert.support;

final class StringToInteger implements Converter<String, Integer> {

    public Integer convert(String source) {
        return Integer.valueOf(source);
    }

}
```
