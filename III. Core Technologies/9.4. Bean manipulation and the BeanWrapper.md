## 9.4 Bean manipulation and the BeanWrapper

The`org.springframework.beans`package adheres to the JavaBeans standard provided by Oracle. A JavaBean is simply a class with a default no-argument constructor, which follows a naming convention where \(by way of an example\) a property named`bingoMadness`would have a setter method`setBingoMadness(..)`and a getter method`getBingoMadness()`. For more information about JavaBeans and the specification, please refer to Oracle’s website \([javabeans](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/beans/package-summary.html)\).

One quite important class in the beans package is the`BeanWrapper`interface and its corresponding implementation \(`BeanWrapperImpl`\). As quoted from the javadocs, the`BeanWrapper`offers functionality to set and get property values \(individually or in bulk\), get property descriptors, and to query properties to determine if they are readable or writable. Also, the`BeanWrapper`offers support for nested properties, enabling the setting of properties on sub-properties to an unlimited depth. Then, the`BeanWrapper`supports the ability to add standard JavaBeans`PropertyChangeListeners`and`VetoableChangeListeners`, without the need for supporting code in the target class. Last but not least, the`BeanWrapper`provides support for the setting of indexed properties. The`BeanWrapper`usually isn’t used by application code directly, but by the`DataBinder`and the`BeanFactory`.

The way the`BeanWrapper`works is partly indicated by its name:_it wraps a bean_to perform actions on that bean, like setting and retrieving properties.
