### 7.15.3 Convenient access to low-level resources

For optimal usage and understanding of application contexts, users should generally familiarize themselves with Spring’s`Resource`abstraction, as described in the chapter[Chapter 8,Resources](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#resources).

An application context is a`ResourceLoader`, which can be used to load`Resource`s. A`Resource`is essentially a more feature rich version of the JDK class`java.net.URL`, in fact, the implementations of the`Resource`wrap an instance of`java.net.URL`where appropriate. A`Resource`can obtain low-level resources from almost any location in a transparent fashion, including from the classpath, a filesystem location, anywhere describable with a standard URL, and some other variations. If the resource location string is a simple path without any special prefixes, where those resources come from is specific and appropriate to the actual application context type.

You can configure a bean deployed into the application context to implement the special callback interface,`ResourceLoaderAware`, to be automatically called back at initialization time with the application context itself passed in as the`ResourceLoader`. You can also expose properties of type`Resource`, to be used to access static resources; they will be injected into it like any other properties. You can specify those`Resource`properties as simple String paths, and rely on a special JavaBean`PropertyEditor`that is automatically registered by the context, to convert those text strings to actual`Resource`objects when the bean is deployed.

The location path or paths supplied to an`ApplicationContext`constructor are actually resource strings, and in simple form are treated appropriately to the specific context implementation.`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`treats a simple location path as a classpath location. You can also use location paths \(resource strings\) with special prefixes to force loading of definitions from the classpath or a URL, regardless of the actual context type.
