## 3.6 Core Container Improvements

There have been several general improvements to the core container:

* Spring now treats [_generic types\_as a form of\_qualifier_](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-generics-as-qualifiers) when injecting Beans. For example, if you are using a Spring Data `Repository`you can now easily inject a specific implementation: `@Autowired Repository <Customer> customerRepository`.
* If you use Springâ€™s meta-annotation support, you can now develop custom annotations that [expose specific attributes from the source annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-meta-annotations).
* Beans can now be \_ordered \_when they are [autowired into lists and arrays](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-autowired-annotation). Both the`@Order`annotation and`Ordered`interface are supported.
* The`@Lazy`annotation can now be used on injection points, as well as on`@Bean`definitions.
* The[`@Description`annotation has been introduced](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-java-bean-description) for developers using Java-based configuration.
* A generalized model for [conditionally filtering beans](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-java-conditional) has been added via the`@Conditional`annotation. This is similar to`@Profile`support but allows for user-defined strategies to be developed programmatically.
* [CGLIB-based proxy classes](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#aop-pfb-proxy-types) no longer require a default constructor. Support is provided via the [objenesis](https://code.google.com/p/objenesis/) library which is repackaged \_inline \_and distributed as part of the Spring Framework. With this strategy, no constructor at all is being invoked for proxy instances anymore.
* There is managed time zone support across the framework now, e.g. on`LocaleContext`.
