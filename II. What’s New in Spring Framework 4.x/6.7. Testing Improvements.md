## 6.7 Testing Improvements

* The JUnit support in the _Spring TestContext Framework _now requires JUnit 4.12 or higher.
* New`SpringRunner`_alias_for the`SpringJUnit4ClassRunner`.
* Test related annotations may now be declared on interfaces — for example, for use with _test interfaces _that make use of Java 8 based interface default methods.
* An empty declaration of`@ContextConfiguration`can now be completely omitted if default XML files, Groovy scripts, or`@Configuration`classes are detected.
* `@Transactional`test methods are no longer required to be`public`\(e.g., in TestNG and JUnit 5\).
* `@BeforeTransaction`and`@AfterTransaction`methods are no longer required to be`public`and may now be declared on Java 8 based interface default methods.
* The`ApplicationContext`cache in the_Spring TestContext Framework_is now bounded with a default maximum size of 32 and a_least recently used _eviction policy. The maximum size can be configured by setting a JVM system property or Spring property called`spring.test.context.cache.maxSize`.
* New`ContextCustomizer`API for customizing a test`ApplicationContext`_after _bean definitions have been loaded into the context but _before_the context has been refreshed. Customizers can be registered globally by third parties, foregoing the need to implement custom`ContextLoader`.
* `@Sql`and`@SqlGroup`may now be used as_meta-annotations_to create custom_composed annotations_with attribute overrides.
* `ReflectionTestUtils`now automatically unwraps proxies when setting or getting a field.
* Server-side Spring MVC Test supports expectations on response headers with multiple values.
* Server-side Spring MVC Test parses form data request content and populates request parameters.
* Server-side Spring MVC Test supports mock-like assertions for invoked handler methods.
* Client-side REST test support allows indicating how many times a request is expected and whether the order of declaration for expectations should be ignored \(see [Section 15.6.3, “Client-Side REST Tests”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#spring-mvc-test-client)\).
* Client-side REST Test supports expectations for form data in the request body.
