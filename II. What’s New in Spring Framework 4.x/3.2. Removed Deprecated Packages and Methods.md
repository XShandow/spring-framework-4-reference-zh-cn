## 3.2Â Removed Deprecated Packages and Methods

All deprecated packages, and many deprecated classes and methods have been removed with version 4.0. If you are upgrading from a previous release of Spring, you should ensure that you have fixed any deprecated calls that you were making to outdated APIs.

For a complete set of changes, check out the[API Differences Report](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.4.RELEASE_to_4.0.0.RELEASE/).

Note that optional third-party dependencies have been raised to a 2010/2011 minimum \(i.e. Spring 4 generally only supports versions released in late 2010 or later now\): notably, Hibernate 3.6+, EhCache 2.1+, Quartz 1.8+, Groovy 1.8+, and Joda-Time 2.0+. As an exception to the rule, Spring 4 requires the recent Hibernate Validator 4.3+, and support for Jackson has been focused on 2.0+ now \(with Jackson 1.8/1.9 support retained for the time being where Spring 3.2 had it; now just in deprecated form\).
