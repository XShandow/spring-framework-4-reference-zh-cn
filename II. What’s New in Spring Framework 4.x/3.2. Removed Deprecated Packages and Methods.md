## 3.2 Removed Deprecated Packages and Methods

All deprecated packages, and many deprecated classes and methods have been removed with version 4.0. If you are upgrading from a previous release of Spring, you should ensure that you have fixed any deprecated calls that you were making to outdated APIs.  
所有过时的包和许多过时的类和方法已经从Spring4中移除。如果你从之前的发布版升级Spring，你需要保证已经修复了所有使用过时的API方法。

Note that optional third-party dependencies have been raised to a 2010/2011 minimum \(i.e. Spring 4 generally only supports versions released in late 2010 or later now\): notably, Hibernate 3.6+, EhCache 2.1+, Quartz 1.8+, Groovy 1.8+, and Joda-Time 2.0+. As an exception to the rule, Spring 4 requires the recent Hibernate Validator 4.3+, and support for Jackson has been focused on 2.0+ now \(with Jackson 1.8/1.9 support retained for the time being where Spring 3.2 had it; now just in deprecated form\).  
请注意，所有可选的第三方依赖都已经升级到了最低2010/2011\(例如Spring4 通常只支持 2010 年的最新或者现在的最新发布版本\):尤其是 Hibernate 3.6+、EhCache 2.1+、Quartz 1.8+、Groovy 1.8+、Joda-Time 2.0+。但是有一个例外，Spring4依赖最近的Hibernate Validator 4.3+，现在对Jackson的支持集中在2.0+版本 \(Spring3.2支持的Jackson 1.8/1.9，现在已经过时）。
