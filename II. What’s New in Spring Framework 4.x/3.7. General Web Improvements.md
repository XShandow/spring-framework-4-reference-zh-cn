## 3.7 General Web Improvements

Deployment to Servlet 2.5 servers remains an option, but Spring Framework 4.0 is now focused primarily on Servlet 3.0+ environments. If you are using the[Spring MVC Test Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#spring-mvc-test-framework)you will need to ensure that a Servlet 3.0 compatible JAR is in your_test classpath_.

In addition to the WebSocket support mentioned later, the following general improvements have been made to Spring’s Web modules:

* You can use the [new`@RestController`annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-ann-restcontroller) with Spring MVC applications, removing the need to add`@ResponseBody`to each of your`@RequestMapping`methods.
* The`AsyncRestTemplate`class has been added,[allowing non-blocking asynchronous support](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#rest-async-resttemplate) when developing REST clients.
* Spring now offers [comprehensive timezone support](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-timezone) when developing Spring MVC applications.
