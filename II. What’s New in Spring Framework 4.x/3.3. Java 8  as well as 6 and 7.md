## 3.3 Java 8 \(as well as 6 and 7\)

Spring Framework 4.0 provides support for several Java 8 features. You can make use of_lambda expressions_and_method references_with Spring’s callback interfaces. There is first-class support for`java.time`\([JSR-310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310)\), and several existing annotations have been retrofitted as`@Repeatable`. You can also use Java 8’s parameter name discovery \(based on the`-parameters`compiler flag\) as an alternative to compiling your code with debug information enabled.

Spring remains compatible with older versions of Java and the JDK: concretely, Java SE 6 \(specifically, a minimum level equivalent to JDK 6 update 18, as released in January 2010\) and above are still fully supported. However, for newly started development projects based on Spring 4, we recommend the use of Java 7 or 8.
