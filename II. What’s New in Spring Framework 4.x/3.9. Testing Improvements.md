## 3.9 Testing Improvements

In addition to pruning of deprecated code within the`spring-test`module, Spring Framework 4.0 introduces several new features for use in unit and integration testing.

* Almost all annotations in the`spring-test`module \(e.g.,`@ContextConfiguration`,`@WebAppConfiguration`,`@ContextHierarchy`,`@ActiveProfiles`, etc.\) can now be used as [meta-annotations](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#integration-testing-annotations-meta) to create custom _composed annotations _and reduce configuration duplication across a test suite.
* Active bean definition profiles can now be resolved programmatically, simply by implementing a custom [`ActiveProfilesResolver`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-ctx-management-env-profiles-ActiveProfilesResolver)and registering it via the`resolver`attribute of`@ActiveProfiles`.
* A new`SocketUtils`class has been introduced in the`spring-core`module which enables you to scan for free TCP and UDP server ports on localhost. This functionality is not specific to testing but can prove very useful when writing integration tests that require the use of sockets, for example tests that start an in-memory SMTP server, FTP server, Servlet container, etc.
* As of Spring 4.0, the set of mocks in the`org.springframework.mock.web`package is now based on the Servlet 3.0 API. Furthermore, several of the Servlet API mocks \(e.g.,`MockHttpServletRequest`,`MockServletContext`, etc.\) have been updated with minor enhancements and improved configurability.
