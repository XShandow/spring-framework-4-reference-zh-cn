## 4.2 Caching Improvements

Spring 4.1 supports[JCache \(JSR-107\) annotations](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#cache-jsr-107)using Springâ€™s existing cache configuration and infrastructure abstraction; no changes are required to use the standard annotations.

Spring 4.1 also improves its own caching abstraction significantly:

* Caches can be resolved at runtime using a[`CacheResolver`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#cache-annotations-cacheable-cache-resolver). As a result the`value`argument defining the cache name\(s\) to use is no longer mandatory.
* More operation-level customizations: cache resolver, cache manager, key generator
* A new[`@CacheConfig`class-level annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#cache-annotations-config)allows common settings to be shared at the class level **without **enabling any cache operation.
* Better exception handling of cached methods using`CacheErrorHandler`

Spring 4.1 also has a breaking change in the`Cache`interface as a new`putIfAbsent`method has been added.
