## 4.3 Web Improvements

* The existing support for resource handling based on the`ResourceHttpRequestHandler`has been expanded with new abstractions`ResourceResolver`,`ResourceTransformer`, and`ResourceUrlProvider`. A number of built-in implementations provide support for versioned resource URLs \(for effective HTTP caching\), locating gzipped resources, generating an HTML 5 AppCache manifests, and more. See [Section 22.16.9, “Serving of Resources”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-config-static-resources).
* JDK 1.8’s`java.util.Optional`is now supported for`@RequestParam`,`@RequestHeader`, and`@MatrixVariable`controller method arguments.
* `ListenableFuture`is supported as a return value alternative to`DeferredResult`where an underlying service \(or perhaps a call to`AsyncRestTemplate`\) already returns`ListenableFuture`.
* `@ModelAttribute`methods are now invoked in an order that respects inter-dependencies. See[SPR-6299](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-6299).
* Jackson’s`@JsonView`is supported directly on`@ResponseBody`and`ResponseEntity`controller methods for serializing different amounts of detail for the same POJO \(e.g. summary vs. detail page\). This is alsosupported with View-based rendering by adding the serialization view type as a model attribute under a special key. See[the section called “Jackson Serialization View Support”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-ann-jsonview)for details.
* JSONP is now supported with Jackson. See[the section called “Jackson JSONP Support”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-ann-jsonp).
* A new lifecycle option is available for intercepting`@ResponseBody`and`ResponseEntity `methods just after the controller method returns and before the response is written. To take advantage declare an`@ControllerAdvice`bean that implements`ResponseBodyAdvice`. The built-in support for`@JsonView`and JSONP take advantage of this. See [Section 22.4.1, “Intercepting requests with a HandlerInterceptor”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-handlermapping-interceptor).
* There are three new`HttpMessageConverter`options:

  * Gson — lighter footprint than Jackson; has already been in use in Spring Android.
  * Google Protocol Buffers — efficient and effective as an inter-service communication data protocol within an enterprise but can also be exposed as JSON and XML for browsers.
  * Jackson based XML serialization is now supported through the [jackson-dataformat-xml](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml)extension. When using`@EnableWebMvc`or`<mvc:annotation-driven/>`, this is used by default instead of JAXB2 if`jackson-dataformat-xml`is in the classpath.

* Views such as JSPs can now build links to controllers by referring to controller mappings by name. A default name is assigned to every`@RequestMapping`. For example`FooController`with method`handleFoo`is named "FC\#handleFoo". The naming strategy is pluggable. It is also possible to name an`@RequestMapping`explicitly through its name attribute. A new`mvcUrl`function in the Spring JSP tag library makes this easy to use in JSP pages. See [Section 22.7.3, “Building URIs to Controllers and methods from views”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-links-to-controllers-from-views).

* `ResponseEntity`provides a builder-style API to guide controller methods towards the preparation of server-side responses,e.g.`ResponseEntity.ok()`.
* `RequestEntity`is a new type that provides a builder-style API to guide client-side REST code towards the preparation of HTTP requests.
* MVC Java config and XML namespace:

  * View resolvers can now be configured including support for content negotiation, see [Section 22.16.8, “View Resolvers”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-config-view-resolvers).
  * View controllers now have built-in support for redirects and for setting the response status. An application can use this to configure redirect URLs, render 404 responses with a view, send "no content" responses, etc. Some use cases are [listed here](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-11543?focusedCommentId=100308&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-100308).
  * Path matching customizations are frequently used and now built-in. See [Section 22.16.11, “Path Matching”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc-config-path-matching).

* [Groovy markup template](http://groovy-lang.org/docs/groovy-2.3.6/html/documentation/markup-template-engine.html) support \(based on Groovy 2.3\). See the`GroovyMarkupConfigurer`and respecitve`ViewResolver`and \`View' implementations.
