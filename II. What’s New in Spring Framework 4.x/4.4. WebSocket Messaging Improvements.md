## 4.4 WebSocket Messaging Improvements

* SockJS \(Java\) client-side support. See`SockJsClient`and classes in same package.
* New application context events`SessionSubscribeEvent`and`SessionUnsubscribeEvent`published when STOMP clients subscribe and unsubscribe.
* New "websocket" scope. See [Section 26.4.15, “WebSocket Scope”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#websocket-stomp-websocket-scope).
* `@SendToUser`can target only a single session and does not require an authenticated user.
* `@MessageMapping`methods can use dot "." instead of slash "/" as path separator. See[SPR-11660](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-11660).
* STOMP/WebSocket monitoring info collected and logged. See [Section 26.4.17, “Runtime Monitoring”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#websocket-stomp-stats).
* Significantly optimized and improved logging that should remain very readable and compact even at DEBUG level.
* Optimized message creation including support for temporary message mutability and avoiding automatic message id and timestamp creation. See Javadoc of`MessageHeaderAccessor`.
* Close STOMP/WebSocket connections that have no activity within 60 seconds after the WebSocket session is established. See [SPR-11884](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-11884).
