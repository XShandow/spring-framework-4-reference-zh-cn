## 4.5 Testing Improvements
测试改进

* Groovy scripts can now be used to configure the`ApplicationContext`loaded for integration tests in the TestContext framework.
* Groovy脚本现在能使用ApplicationContext配置，在TestContext框架中整合测试。

  * See [the section called “Context configuration with Groovy scripts”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-ctx-management-groovy) for details.
  * 查看the section called “Context configuration with Groovy scripts”更多细节。
  
* Test-managed transactions can now be programmatically started and ended within transactional test methods via the new`TestTransaction`API.
* 现在通过新的TestTransaction接口，使用编程化来开始结束测试管理事务。

  * See [the section called “Programmatic transaction management”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-tx-programmatic-tx-mgt) for details.

* SQL script execution can now be configured declaratively via the new`@Sql`and`@SqlConfig`annotations on a per-class or per-method basis.

  * See [Section 15.5.8, “Executing SQL scripts”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-executing-sql) for details.

* Test property sources which automatically override system and application property sources can be configured via the new`@TestPropertySource`annotation.

  * See [the section called “Context configuration with test property sources”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-ctx-management-property-sources) for details.

* Default`TestExecutionListener`s can now be automatically discovered.

  * See [the section called “Automatic discovery of default TestExecutionListeners”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-tel-config-automatic-discovery) for details.

* Custom`TestExecutionListener`s can now be automatically merged with the default listeners.

  * See [the section called “Merging TestExecutionListeners”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-tel-config-merging) for details.

* The documentation for transactional testing support in the TestContext framework has been improved with more thorough explanations and additional examples.

  * See [Section 15.5.7, “Transaction management”](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-tx) for details.

* Various improvements to`MockServletContext`,`MockHttpServletRequest`, and other Servlet API mocks.

* `AssertThrows`has been refactored to support`Throwable`instead of`Exception`.
* In Spring MVC Test, JSON responses can be asserted with [JSON Assert](https://github.com/skyscreamer/JSONassert) as an extra option to using JSONPath much like it has been possible to do for XML with XMLUnit.
* `MockMvcBuilder`_recipes _can now be created with the help of`MockMvcConfigurer`. This was added to make it easy to apply Spring Security setup but can be used to encapsulate common setup for any 3rd party framework or within a project.
* `MockRestServiceServer`now supports the`AsyncRestTemplate`for client-side testing.
